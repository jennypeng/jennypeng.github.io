<h4>Hi, my name is Jenny Peng!</h4>


I'm a second year <b>computer science</b> student at <b>UC Berkeley</b>, interested in all things <b>web dev</b> related.
Up until college, my focus in life was traditional art. It wasn't until my freshmen year in an introductory Python course that I first discovered programming, and since then
I have developed a <b>passion for learning about technology and code as an art</b>.

I believe that traditional art should be beautiful, enabling, emotive, and innovative.

<b>I believe that code should be the same way.</b>
<br>
<br>
I like napping, visual novels, salmon sashimi, bug catching, comics, and all things horror related.
Have a look around my site!
