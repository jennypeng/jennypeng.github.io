As an effort to teach myself server-side programming and databases along with both front-end and back-end web dev, I implemented an image discussion board using Mongodb, Express, Jade and Node.JS.

After toying around with Node.JS in my Image Board project, I realized I wanted to take advantage of its event driven, asynchronous I/O model to create real-time apps. As a result, I programmed a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" target="_blank">Amiga</a> themed real-time command parsing chat using Socket.io.

<h3 id = "title">This Website</h3>
I started this website as a form of procrastination during finals week of my freshmen year!
So far, it has been an adventure into Javascript, CSS, HTML, along with various types of frameworks.
