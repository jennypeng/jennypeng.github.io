  <h2>About me and stuff.</h2>
<p>Let's get to know each other a little better. <3</p>
<h3>Who is Gabriel Ruiz?</h3>
<p>I'm a web developer from UC Berkeley who studies sometimes but usually just ends up coding. My interests include skateboarding, fancy visualizations, exercise, fighting games, free stuff, piano, all sorts of music (hip-hop and ska are my favorites), and some other stuff.</p>
<p>Eventually I'll take over the world with something I create, but for now I'm just working towards being an amazing web developer. <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/14bvli9w9lawfza/GabrielRuizResume.pdf">Here</a> is my resume.</p>
<h3>Why did you make this site?</h3>
<p>I needed somewhere to link to projects. I also used this to productively procrastinate studying for a plant biology midterm.</p>
<h3>How did you make this site?</h3>
<p>I used Jekyll, GitHub pages, lots of love, and an inability to sleep on a normal schedule.</p>
<h3>What is your favorite boba?</h3>
<p>Taro. Free. (Though barley is actually pretty nice too.)</p>
<p>Stay for a bit. Enjoy my projects.</p>
