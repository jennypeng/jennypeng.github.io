		So it's been 4 days since I decided to start learning ruby, specifically, ruby on rails, which I have been hearing a lot about. I'm currently in the process of doing this fantastic <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/book/ruby-on-rails-tutorial" target = _blank>tutorial</a>, which also has a paperback form <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321832051/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321832051&linkCode=as2&tag=therubonraitu-20" target = _blank>here</a>. Honestly, this tutorial has been one of the best I have ever read, and although it's focus is on Rails specifically, it covers a large part of security, REST architecture, version control, Heroku, and a lot more. I think my favorite thing about it is, that opposed to most tutorials I've seen online, Michael Hartl teaches you real world practicality. I've never read a tutorial that covered web conventions, code readability, and deployment as thoroughly as this one. In addition, a large portion of the text is set aside just for test driven development, using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle of writing intentionally failing tests (red), then passing them (green), and then using abstraction to reduce code based on the DRY principle (refactor). From now on, I'll aim to adopt this testing practice.

		Continuing on to my opinion of Ruby/Rails, I really now understand why people say that reading Ruby is like reading english. I found the high-levelness of the language to be pleasantly easy to digest, compared to lower leveled languages. I tried getting my younger friend with no programming skills to try it out, and due to its readability and extremely intuitive design, my friend easily picked it up. Rails, on the otherhand, was a surprise. Compared to the previous web "frameworks" I had used, like nodeJS and flask, rails was overwhelmingly comprehensive. What shocked me about it was how many methods and utilities were already built in. For example, relational databases, pagination, and database ordering by most recent could be implemented with less than 3 lines of code. My first impression of Rails could be quickly summarized with the quote, "With great power, comes great responsibility". Anyways, tl;dr, after I finish the tutorial, I'm going to try to create a blogging engine like Tumblr to step out of the sandbox and see if I can manage without step-by-step instructions.

		Last night, when I was working on my website I realized that I had made a huge error. For a greenhorn programmer like me, it was easy for me to forget about cross-browser compatibility during programming. I realized that what my website looks like locally on Chrome will most likely not look the same as it might look on say, my friends Mozilla browser or on a a stranger's mobile browser. As a result, my website only looks as intended on Chrome. As a couple examples of what I mean by this, both stylizing default zoom amount and customizing scrollbars are only compatible with newer browsers. Though customized scrollbars are just a flourish, my set default zoom ensured that the view was not distorted. Since stylizing zoom was a CSS3 element, the display for my website did not work well on some unsupported browsers. From now on I'll continue working on making my site cross-browser compatible.

		Some things that I have taken from this:
		<ol>
		<li> While developing a site, test your stylesheets along the way! Do not try to reinvent the wheel, and use existing libraries to abstract away potential problems caused by hackish programming.</li>
		<li> It is good to adopt a perspective of test-driven development. Especially at the hours of 6 AM, without prior testing, every hour you spend coding is three hours spent debugging. </li>
		<li> document.getElementByID('ID') is not the same thing as jQuery's $('#ID'). The former returns a DOM object, while the latter returns either a DOM wrapper or a set of DOM elements. As a result, these are not always interchangeable. </li>
		<li> JavaScript's NaN behaves in funky ways. </li>
		<li> Good music and good food always makes coding ten times more enjoyable early in the morning. </li>
		</ol>

		On an unrelated note, I decided to start learning Ruby today. Wish me luck on my journey!
